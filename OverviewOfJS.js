// Que - What is javascript ?

// Ans - JavaScript is a powerful, flexible programming language used to make websites interactive and dynamic.

// It runs in the browser (like Chrome, Firefox) and also on the server (via Node.js).

//Technical Defination
//  JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted, multi-paradigm, prototype-based, dynamically typed language primarily used for web development.

// JavaScript Terminology – Fully Explained

// First

// 🔹 1. High-level
// “You don’t have to manage memory or hardware manually.”

// What it means:

// You write code in a way that’s easy for humans to understand.

// You don’t have to worry about complex things like:

// Memory allocation

// Pointers

// CPU registers or hardware specifics

// let name = "Samarth";
// Behind the scenes, JavaScript:

// Finds memory to store "Samarth"

// Tracks it with the variable name

// Frees memory later using Garbage Collection

// 🧠 You just focus on logic, not how memory is stored or released. That’s why it’s called high-level.

// JavaScript is a high-level language, which means:

// ✅ You don’t worry about how memory is managed.

// ✅ You don’t handle hardware or low-level stuff.

// ✅ You can just focus on writing logic to build websites, apps, and APIs.
